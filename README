= Roundup

This project aims to provide an easy to use interface to the rally rest api via ruby.

The intention is to provide a wrapper to the existing rally_rest_api gem to provide
scriptable access to the most commonly used features while developing during a sprint.

The further intention is to provide a vim plugin to unify the rally management within
your favorite editor.
